### How to run the code:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Start a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Run `python3 webserver.py` to start the server.

### Testing the server:
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the server in action.
3. Visit different endpoints like `http://localhost:8080/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/words.txt` or `http://localhost:8080/contact.html` to test specific routes.
2. You can also use tools like `curl` or Postman to send requests to the server.
4. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
